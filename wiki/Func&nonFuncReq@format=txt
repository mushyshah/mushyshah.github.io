== Functional and Non-functional Requirements ==
=== Functional Requirements ===
  * Read in a character profile and parse out relevant information
  * GUI to keep track of vital information such as health, gold, and items
  * Ability to change stats
  * Provide information about attacks and skills
  * Ability to restart certain stats (create new day)

=== Non-Functional Requirements ===
  * Usability
    * User must have knowledge of the game and rules
    * Interface will be similar to paper traditionally used in game, familiarity with those will be beneficial
    * Character profiles can be imported from an online character-building website
  * Reliability
    * Must be reliable for duration of game
    * After a failure it can be restarted, but changes made during then game may be lost in this process (changes to health/armour)
    * Data should not be lost, as some changes can carry over to additional games-
  * Performance
    * Should be able to make changes and have them appear by the end of turn (instantaneously would be best)
    * User tasks are turn based, with a normal turn taking a few minutes at most, must be able to affect changes during this time
    * Each user is responsible for their own character so there will not be any concurrent use
    * Latency should be minimized to ensure turns do not take a long time
    * There will be a reasonable amount of data to store per character (initial health, armour, attacks, items)
  * Supportability
    * Support will depend on the platform of the user
  * Interface
    * Data will be imported via a file obtained from a website. This file will be parsed through to obtain necessary information
  * Packaging
    * The installation will be done by the user, unlimited times
  * Legal
    * It may infringe on the Dungeons and Dragons brand, though that would need to be researched further
