'''Functional Description'''




Design an application to act as an interactive character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons, specifically the 4th edition of the game.
The application will ideally work on a [[BR]]
tablet or phone interface with the windows operating system. The character sheet information is loaded from the Dungeons and Dragons character builder[[BR]]
A Link to the builder can be found here: [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/characterbuilder][[BR]]

To access the account use accountName: torrencio1[@]gmail.com
                                                password:    Frankpencil123
This character builder creates an XML file, this file will be parsed through in order to gather required information. [[BR]]
The application will only allow for one character sheet to be open at a time, but it should be easy to load in different character sheets.[[BR]][[BR]]

All Player stats must be tracked and easy to modify.
The application needs to saves values such as health and healing surges in order to keep track for the next play session.[[BR]]
Gold currency and items need to have an option to add, replace, or change.[[BR]]
The Application must be able to track conditions and how they affect the character data.[[BR]]
[[BR]]

When playing DnD, the application should be able to keep track of which abilities are available, and should handle any calculations needed for the ability including the dice roll.[[BR]]
The dice roll should be optional, some people just like dice. With that, there should also be an option for free dice, to roll a die of any type and add any required modifiers.[[BR]][[BR]]

There will be an option to let the character sheet know that a new turn has come up and the move, standard and minor are available.[[BR]]
The application needs to have the ability to modify any of the main data depending on what happens in the game.[[BR]]
