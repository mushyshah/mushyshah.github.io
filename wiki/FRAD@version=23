          <h2 id="FunctionalDescription">Functional Description</h2>
<p>
A functional description of what you are planning to build. Consider inputs and outputs and what you are trying to accomplish. A diagram might best describe these concepts.
</p>
<h2 id="FunctionalandNon-functionalRequirements">Functional and Non-functional Requirements</h2>
<p>
A list of functional and non-functional requirements.
</p>
<h2 id="UseCases">Use Cases</h2>
<p>
Note1: All use cases involve the player interacting with the GUI, and the GUI making the appropriate visual changes (and in some cases to the background data stored).<br />
Note: For the sake of avoiding redundancy, all use cases share the same Participating Actor.<br />
Participating Actor: The 'player', or owner of the character.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="UseHealingSurge">UseHealingSurge</h3>
<p>
<strong>Flow of Events</strong>: <br />
1. The user would like to increase the health of their character.<br />
2. The user clicks the 'Healing Surge' button.
3. The health of the character increases by 1/4 of their HP and they lose one of their healing surges.<br />
<strong>Entry Condition</strong>: The user must have available healing surges.<br />
<strong>Exit Condition</strong>: The user gets visual feedback that their health has changed and that they have used a surge. <br />
<strong>Quality Requirements</strong>: 
Dungeons and Dragons is a fast paced game to the user must receive fast as possible visual feedback that their action has worked. The calculation for adding health must also be accurate.
</p>
<h3 id="AdjustHealth">AdjustHealth</h3>
<p>
<strong>Flow of Events</strong>: <br />
1. A player would like to adjust their health for a reason other than using a healing surge (ex. lose health when getting hit by attack, gaining extra HP from another player).<br />
2. The player uses a slider to increase or decrease their health by the desired amount.<br />
<strong>Entry Condition</strong>: None.<br />
<strong>Exit Condition</strong>: The user gets visual feedback that their health has changed. <br />
<strong>Quality Requirements</strong>:

<strong>Quality Requirements</strong>: Abilities may require a lot of calculations so this needs to be done quickly as not to slow down game play.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="ChangeStats">ChangeStats</h3>
<p>
<strong>Flow of Events</strong>: <br />
1. The user would like to change the characters stats.<br />
2. The player click on the text field for that particular stat and types the new value.<br />
<strong>Entry Condition</strong>: None.<br />
<strong>Exit Condition</strong>: The program now displays the desired value.<br />
<strong>Quality Requirements</strong>: The test field must be responsive. Also, the new value entered should immediately be used in the next calculation the program does.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="ChangePossessions">ChangePossessions</h3>
<p>
<strong>Flow of Events</strong>:<br />
1. The user would like to add/remove/change the their items or equipment. <br />

Includes <a class="missing wiki">NewDay?</a>: User can click the <a class="missing wiki">NewDay?</a> button to get back their daily powers action point.
<br /><br />
Please see attachment for Use Case Flow Chart. Note that this was hard to illustrate, but the back and forth red arrows indicate the player interacting with the GUI and the GUI showing the player that appropriate visual changes.<br />

<strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong>:<br />
<strong>HP</strong>: Health Points. This is the amount of health that a character has. They lose health when being attacked and can gain health by 'healing'.<br />
<strong>Stats</strong>: The particular strengths and weaknesses of a character. This includes how good their defenses are against attacks and which kinds of attacks they are good at (magic, physical).<br />
<strong>Skills</strong>: The skills that a player can use and how good they are at them. This is dependent on their stats.<br />
<strong>Healing Surge</strong>: A player has a limited number of healing surges that they can use in one day. A healing surge returns 1/4 of the player's HP.<br />
<strong>Encounter</strong>: This is another word for 'battle'. A player enters an encounter when they start a fight with an enemy.<br />
<strong>Action Point</strong>: Each 'turn' in Dungeons and Dragons, a player can do a minor action, move actions, or attack action. If they would like to do an additional action, they can use an action point. The player can only use one action point per day.<br />
<strong>Ability</strong>: Abilities encompass a large variety of things that a character can do. Some examples are use an attack, heal a team member, or turn into an animal.<br />
<strong>Daily/Encounter Abilities</strong>: Characters have powerful abilities that they can only use once per encounter or once per day.<br />
